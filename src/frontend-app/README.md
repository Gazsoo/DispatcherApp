Tailwind's dark mode works by using a CSS class-based system where you add a dark class to a parent element (typically <html>) to activate dark mode styles throughout your app. When you write utility classes like bg-white dark:bg-gray-900, Tailwind generates two CSS rules: one that always applies (bg-white) and another that only applies when a parent element has the dark class (.dark .dark\:bg-gray-900). In your JavaScript, you toggle dark mode by adding or removing the dark class from the <html> element using document.documentElement.classList.add('dark'), which instantly activates all the dark: prefixed utilities across your entire app. This approach gives you full control—you can store the user's preference in localStorage, create a toggle button, and the theme persists across sessions. Tailwind also supports an alternative media mode that automatically follows the user's system preference via the prefers-color-scheme CSS media query, but the class mode is more common because it lets users override their system settings and provides a manual toggle experience.
